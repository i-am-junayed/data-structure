### Question_1: Delete the 3rd Element from the End of a Doubly Linked List
Consider a **Doubly Linked List (dll)**. Write a Python function that deletes the **3rd element from the end** of the list.  
You may assume that `dll` contains **more than 5 elements**.

**For example :**
if the given **dll** is: **3 <==> 4 <==> 6 <==> 32 <==> 6 <==> 9 <==> 6**. 

after calling the function the **dll** should be like this : **3 <==> 4 <==> 6 <==> 32 <==> 9 <==> 6**.
