### Question_1: Delete the 3rd Element from the End of a Doubly Linked List
Consider a **Doubly Linked List (dll)**. Write a Python function that deletes the **3rd element from the end** of the list.  
You may assume that `dll` contains **more than 5 elements**.

**For example :**
if the given **dll** is: **3 ↔ 4 ↔ 6 ↔ 32 ↔ 6 ↔ 9 ↔ 6**. 

after calling the function the **dll** should be like this : **3 ↔ 4 ↔ 6 ↔ 32 ↔ 9 ↔ 6**.

### Question_2: Check if a Doubly Linked List is Symmetric

Consider a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** implemented in a `DLL` class. Write a method named `isSymmetric(self)` that determines whether the items in the linked list are arranged symmetrically.

For example:  
- Given the **DLL**:  **head → 1 ↔ 2 ↔ 3 ↔ 2 ↔ 1 ← tail** is symmetric, therefore, the function should return True.
- But if the **DLL** is: **head → 1 ↔ 2 ↔ 3 ↔ 1 ← tail** is not symmetric, therefore the function should return False.
